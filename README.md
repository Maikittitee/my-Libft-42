# my-Libft-42

Be careful

1.Make sure you include libft'.h' not '.c'

2.Make sure your function name is CORRECT (Don't forget to ad 'ft' before function name)

3.You need to compile by "gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra" 

4. Don't forget to remove "a.out" or "other irrelevant file" 

**if you not do all this list -> You may can't run tester**
